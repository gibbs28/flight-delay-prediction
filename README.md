# flight-delay-prediction - UT Austin MSBA Project

This project builds a machine-learning model to predict U.S. flight delays using BTS flight records and NOAA weather data. We clean, merge, and engineer features combining operational, temporal, and weather conditions, then evaluate several models to identify key drivers of delays. Results show that airport congestion (rolling delays) and adverse weather are the strongest predictors, with LightGBM providing the best overall performance
